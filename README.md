# Advanced VWAP Reclaim Strategy with ATR Filter & Bracket Orders

## Overview  
This Pine Script strategy implements an advanced intraday trading system based on VWAP reclaim signals combined with ATR-based stop loss and take profit levels. It features time window filtering and enforces a daily trade limit, making it a robust solution for intraday traders.

## Strategy Features  
- *VWAP Reclaim Entry:* Enters long positions when price crosses above the VWAP after being below it.  
- *ATR-Based Risk Management:* Dynamic stop loss and take profit levels calculated using Average True Range (ATR) multipliers.  
- *Intraday Time Window:* Trades are only taken within the user-defined market session (default 9:30 AM to 3:30 PM EST).  
- *Max Trades Per Day:* Limits the number of trades executed daily to control overtrading.  
- *Bracket Orders:* Entry, stop loss, and take profit orders are managed simultaneously for better risk control.  
- *Alert Conditions:* Supports alerts for entry signals to integrate with automation platforms like Zapier and Alpaca.
